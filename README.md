# Self_Driving_Car_By_CNN_Neural_Network
Interesting deep learning fun project with Python :A self-driving car!😃👌

First, I used the recording mode in the simulation game to manually play and capture game frames and steering wheel angles simultaneously. Then, I used these images to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict the wheel angle based on the image. After training the model, I implemented it in the autonomous mode of the game, and the car was controlled by the CNN model. This project served as a fantastic learning experience, and I highly recommend trying it yourself!😃✌️
